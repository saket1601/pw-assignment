        "Theory Questions\n",
        "1.\tDifference between interpreted and compiled languages:\n",
        "○ Compiled languages are translated directly into machine code that the processor can execute. This translation process, called compilation, is done before the program is run. Examples include C, C++, and Java.\n",
        "○ Interpreted languages, on the other hand, are not directly compiled into machine code. Instead, a program called an interpreter reads and executes the code line by line. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are examples of interpreted languages.\n",
        "2.\t[cite_start]What is exception handling in Python? Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to deal with runtime errors. Instead of letting the program crash, you can catch these errors (exceptions) and execute specific code to handle them gracefully.\n",
        "3.\tPurpose of the finally block: The finally block in exception handling is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's typically used for cleanup actions, like closing files or network connections, ensuring that these essential operations are always performed.\n",
        "4.\t[cite_start]What is logging in Python? Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when a program runs. The logging module in Python provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from applications. [cite_start]These messages can be used to diagnose problems and monitor the application's state.\n",
        "5.\tSignificance of the __del__ method: The __del__ method is a finalizer in Python. It's called when an object is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector. While you can define it to perform cleanup tasks for an object, it's generally better to use context managers (with statement) for resource management as the exact timing of __del__'s execution is not guaranteed.\n",
        "6.\t[cite_start]Difference between import and from...import:\n",
        "○ import module_name: This imports the entire module. You need to use the module name as a prefix to access its functions or variables (e.g., module_name.function()).\n",
        "○ from module_name import function_name: This imports a specific function or variable from the module directly into the current namespace. You can then use it without the module prefix (e.g., function_name()).\n",
        "7.\t[cite_start]How to handle multiple exceptions: You can handle multiple exceptions in a single except block by passing a tuple of exception types. For example: except (ValueError, TypeError):. Alternatively, you can have multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions with specific logic for each.\n",
        "8.\tPurpose of the with statement: The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common try...finally cleanup tasks. When used with files, it automatically ensures that the file is closed when the block is exited, even if errors occur.\n",
        "9.\t[cite_start]Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing:\n",
        "○ Multithreading: Multiple threads run within the same process, sharing the same memory space. It's useful for I/O-bound tasks where the program spends time waiting for external resources.\n",
        "○ Multiprocessing: Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space. It's ideal for CPU-bound tasks as it can leverage multiple CPU cores to perform computations in parallel.\n",
        "10.\t[cite_start]Advantages of using logging: Logging provides several benefits:\n",
        "○\tDiagnostics: It helps in debugging and understanding how the program is executing.\n",
        "○ Auditing: It can record events for security and compliance purposes.\n",
        "○ Monitoring: It allows for monitoring the application's health and performance.\n",
        "○ Flexibility: Log messages can be routed to different destinations (console, file, etc.) and filtered by severity level.\n",
        "11.\t[cite_start]What is memory management in Python? Memory management in Python is the process of allocating memory for objects and freeing it when they are no longer in use. Python handles this automatically through a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "12.\tBasic steps in exception handling: The basic steps are:\n",
        "1.\ttry: The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block.\n",
        "2.\texcept: If an exception occurs in the try block, the corresponding except block is executed to handle the error.\n",
        "3.\telse (optional): This block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
        "4.\tfinally (optional): This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "13.\t[cite_start]Why is memory management important? Effective memory management is crucial because it prevents memory leaks (where memory is not released after use), which can lead to the application consuming all available memory and crashing. It ensures the efficient use of system resources.\n",
        "14.\tRole of try and except:\n",
        "○\ttry: The try block encloses the code that you suspect might cause an error.\n",
        "○ except: The except block contains the code that will be executed if a specific exception is raised within the try block. It catches the exception and allows you to handle it.\n",
        "15.\t[cite_start]How Python's garbage collection works: Python's primary garbage collection mechanism is reference counting. Every object has a count of the number of references pointing to it. When this count drops to zero, the object's memory is deallocated. To handle reference cycles (where objects refer to each other), Python also has a cyclic garbage collector that periodically detects and cleans up these cycles.\n",
        "16.\tPurpose of the else block in exception handling: The else block is executed only if the try block completes without raising any exceptions. It's useful for code that should run only when the try part is successful.\n",
        "17.\t[cite_start]Common logging levels: The standard logging levels in increasing order of severity are:\n",
        "○\tDEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "○ INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "○ WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or a problem might occur in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low').\n",
        "○ ERROR: A more serious problem that has prevented a function from performing a task.\n",
        "○ CRITICAL: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "18.\tDifference between os.fork() and multiprocessing:\n",
        "○\tos.fork(): This is a low-level system call available on Unix-like systems that creates a new process which is an exact copy of the parent process. Managing these processes (e.g., communication, synchronization) is manual.\n",
        "○ multiprocessing module: This is a high-level Python library that provides a more convenient and portable way to create and manage processes. It offers tools for inter-process communication and synchronization, abstracting away many of the complexities of os.fork().\n",
        "19.\t[cite_start]Importance of closing a file: Closing a file is important because it releases the file handle back to the operating system. If you don't close a file, changes made to it may not be saved properly, and your program may run out of file descriptors if it opens too many files.\n",
        "20.\t[cite_start]Difference between file.read() and file.readline():\n",
        "○ file.read(size): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string. If an optional size argument is provided, it reads that many bytes.\n",
        "○ file.readline(): Reads a single line from the file, including the newline character at the end. It's useful for reading a file line by line.\n",
        "21.\t[cite_start]What is the logging module used for? The logging module in Python is used to implement a flexible event logging system for applications. It allows developers to configure logging, send log messages to different outputs, and control the verbosity of the output based on different severity levels.\n",
        "22.\t[cite_start]What is the os module used for in file handling? The os module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality. In file handling, it's used for tasks like checking if a file exists (os.path.exists()), renaming a file (os.rename()), removing a file (os.remove()), and working with directories.\n",
        "23.\t[cite_start]Challenges with memory management in Python: While Python's memory management is automatic, challenges can arise from reference cycles that the garbage collector might be slow to clean up, and from extensions written in C that may not properly manage memory, leading to leaks. Memory fragmentation can also be an issue in long-running applications.\n",
        "24.\t[cite_start]How to raise an exception manually: You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword, followed by an exception class. For example: raise ValueError(\"An invalid value was provided\").\n",
        "25.\t[cite_start]Why is it important to use multithreading? Multithreading is important in applications that need to remain responsive while performing long-running tasks, particularly those that are I/O-bound (like network requests or file operations). It allows the application to perform other tasks while one thread is waiting, improving user experience and overall throughput.\n",
