        "Python OOPs Questions (Theory)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). The main idea is to bundle data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, a class, from which objects are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity with its own distinct state (attributes) and behavior (methods). For example, if Car is a class, then a specific red Ferrari would be an object of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class, as well as a set of methods or operations that can be performed on such objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It's about the what, not the how. For example, you know how to use a TV remote without knowing how its internal circuitry works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Is the mechanism of bundling the data (attributes) and the code (methods) that manipulates the data together. It restricts direct access to an object's components, protecting its internal state from accidental modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores, like __init__ or __str__. They are also called magic methods. Python uses them to enable built-in functionalities for custom classes, such as operator overloading (__add__ for +) or object initialization (__init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (called a child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability (\"don't repeat yourself\") and establishes a relationship between the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected. Instead, it uses a convention based on naming:\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected: A single leading underscore (e.g., _variable) signals that an attribute is for internal use and should not be accessed from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Private: A double leading underscore (e.g., __variable) triggers name mangling, making it harder to access the attribute from outside the class (e.g., _ClassName__variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are class and instance methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Method: The most common type of method. It takes the instance itself as the first argument, conventionally named self. It can access and modify both instance and class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Method: Is marked with a @classmethod decorator and takes the class as its first argument, conventionally named cls. It can only access and modify class attributes, not instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static Method: Is marked with a @staticmethod decorator and does not take self or cls as an implicit first argument. It's essentially a regular function namespaced within the class and cannot access or modify the class's or instance's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The new method in the subclass must have the same name and signature as the one in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). If you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition will overwrite the previous ones. However, you can simulate overloading by using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning \"many forms\") allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is important because it allows for writing flexible and generic code. For example, a single function can operate on objects from different subclasses (e.g., Circle, Square) as long as they share a common interface (e.g., an area() method).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the self keyword in Python?\n",
        "The self keyword represents the instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class within its instance methods. It is the first parameter of any instance method, though its name is a convention, not a keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable: Is declared inside the class but outside any method. It is shared among all instances (objects) of the class. A change to a class variable affects all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable: Is declared inside a method, typically the __init__ constructor, using the self keyword. It is unique to each instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is multiple inheritance?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The child class will inherit all the attributes and methods from all its parent classes. Python handles potential conflicts (like the \"Diamond Problem\") using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Explain the purpose of __init__, __str__, and __repr__ methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "__init__: The constructor method. It's automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the instance's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__: Returns an \"informal\" or user-friendly string representation of an object. It's called by the print() function and str() conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__: Returns an \"official\" or developer-focused, unambiguous string representation of an object. If __str__ is not defined, __repr__ is used as a fallback. A good __repr__ should ideally allow you to recreate the object, i.e., eval(repr(obj)) == obj.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the super() method in Python?\n",
        "The super() function returns a temporary proxy object that allows you to call methods of a superclass from its subclass. It's commonly used in method overriding (especially in __init__) to extend the functionality of the parent's method instead of completely replacing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the MRO (Method Resolution Order) in Python?\n",
        "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python searches the hierarchy of classes for a method. It's particularly important in multiple inheritance to determine which parent's method to execute. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to define this order, which you can view using ClassName.mro().\n",
        "\n",
        "18. How does polymorphism work with inheritance?\n",
        "Through inheritance, a child class can override a method from its parent class. Polymorphism allows you to call this method on an object without knowing its specific child class. The correct version of the method (the one in the child class) will be called at runtime. This allows for flexible and decoupled code.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It defines a common interface for its subclasses by including one or more abstract methods (methods with a declaration but no implementation). Subclasses are required to implement these abstract methods. Abstract classes are created in Python using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the purpose of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor. It is called when an object's reference count drops to zero, just before the object is destroyed by the garbage collector. Its use is generally discouraged because the timing of its execution is not guaranteed. It can be used to release external resources like file handles or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Practical Questions\n",
        "Here are the code solutions for the practical questions.\n",
